        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Is there any combination as rewarding and perfectly calibrated as a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich? With
            the crispy, smoky bacon playing off the cool crunch of the lettuce and the acidic sweetness of ripe tomato,
            it's a top contender for Last Meal on Earth status. Bog down the BLT with bulky, sweetened bread and a sea
            of mayo, though, and the appeal vanishesâ€”just as the caloric toll rises.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 slices 7-grain or sourdough bread, lightly toasted</li>
            <li>Handful of arugula (There's been much debate over the perfect lettuce for a BLT. Some prefer the crunch of iceberg or romaine, others like leaves with a peppery bite, like watercress or arugula. It's your choice.)</li>
            <li>3 thick slices of tomato</li>
            <li>4 strips of bacon, cooked</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>  
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Coat with olive oil cooking spray and add the egg.</li>
            <li>Cook sunny side up until the white is set but the yolk is runny.</li>
            <li>Line the bottom half of the bread with the arugula, followed by the tomato slices and bacon.</li>
            <li>Set the cooked egg carefully on top, and season with a pinch of salt and plenty of fresh cracked pepper.</li>
            <li>Top with the second slice of bread.</li>
        </ol>
