        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tart sauerkraut and tangy relish really help make the flavors of this deli classic come alive. Traditionally
            prepared with warm turkey, toasted rye bread, and melted Swiss cheese, this sandwich only <i>sounds</i>
            complicated to make. A quick tip: If you don't have time to whip up your own Reuben sauce from scratch you
            can always pick up salad dressing, such as Russian or Thousand Island, from a local store.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1⁄4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1⁄4 cup olive oil mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp relish</li>
            <li>Few dashes Tabasco sauce</li>
            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lb turkey pastrami (or, failing that, regular turkey)</li>
            <li>4 slices low-fat Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>8 slices rye bread toasted</li>
            <li>1 cup bottled sauerkraut</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the ketchup, mayo, relish, and Tabasco in a bowl and mix. Season with a bit of black pepper. Set
                the dressing aside. (Note: You can always skip this step and buy a bottle of Russian or Thousand Island
                dressing, but it's never as good as the homemade stuff.)</li>
            <li>Divide the pastrami into four portions, pile on plates, and top each with a slice of cheese. Microwave
                briefly, about 30 seconds each, to melt the cheese.</li>
            <li>Lay out four slices of the rye bread on a cutting board. Top each with sauerkraut and then pastrami and
                cheese. Drizzle with the dressing. Top with the remaining slices of bread.</li>
        </ol>
